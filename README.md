# **Student Registration System**

## **Project Overview**
The **Student Registration System** is a web application developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. The application is designed to capture student information through a registration form, validate the input, and store the details securely in a MySQL database.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **PHP**: For server-side logic and handling form submissions.
- **MySQL**: For storing and managing student data.
- **HTML**: For creating the form interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the web page visually appealing.
- **XAMPP**: To provide a local server environment for testing PHP and MySQL.

---

## **Task Description**
The goal of this project was to create a student registration form that captures the following details:
- **Student Name**
- **Student ID**
- **Date of Birth**
- **Course ID**

Once the data is captured, it is inserted into a MySQL database, with feedback provided to the user. The project also ensures proper error handling and validation of the form data.

## **Approach**

1. **Set Up XAMPP**:
   - XAMPP was installed to set up a local development environment for running PHP and MySQL.
   - The MySQL database was created to store student data, and the server was configured to handle PHP scripts.

2. **Creating the Registration Form**:
   - HTML was used to design the form that collects the required student information.
   - Each form field is validated on submission using PHP to ensure that no empty fields are submitted.

3. **Connecting to the Database**:
   - PHP was used to connect to the MySQL database using the `mysqli` extension.
   - The data was sanitized and safely inserted into the database after the form submission.

4. **Error Handling and User Feedback**:
   - Error messages were displayed for connection issues or if the data insertion fails.
   - Successful submissions are confirmed with a success message, providing clear feedback to the user.

5. **Styling**:
   - CSS was applied to improve the user interface, ensuring the form is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

## **Challenges Faced**
- **Database Connection**: Initially, there were issues connecting to the MySQL database due to incorrect configurations in XAMPP. This was resolved by ensuring proper port settings and configuring MySQL to work without a password.
- **Form Validation**: Ensuring all form fields were properly validated before submission posed a challenge, which was handled through PHPâ€™s built-in functions for sanitizing and validating data.
- **Displaying Errors**: Managing error messages to inform the user without exposing sensitive information was an important consideration for security.

## **Conclusion**
The **Student Registration System** project successfully meets the assignment requirements. It demonstrates the ability to:
- Capture user input via a web form.
- Validate and sanitize the data.
- Store data securely in a MySQL database.

By completing this project, we have gained valuable experience in using PHP and MySQL for web development, as well as creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces with HTML and CSS.
